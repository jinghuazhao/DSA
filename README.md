Data Structures and Algorithms

The repository is pedagogical, esp. with cross-references in C++, Java and Python, while addition of libraries for real-world problems will be considered.

* [C](C)
* [C++](C++)
* [Java](java)
* [Python](python)

It also worths to see Simultaneous implementations (in C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) from  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/.

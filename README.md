Data Structures and Algorithms

The repository is pedagogical, esp. with cross-references in C++, Java and Python, while addition of libraries for real-world problems will be considered.

It also worths to see the simultaneous implementations (in C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) from here, https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/.

Book examples from Publishers, e.g.,

* APress, https://github.com/apress
